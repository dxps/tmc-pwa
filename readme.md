# TM Community - PWA edition

This is version 2 of TM Community solution, written as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using `go-app` framework.

<br/>

## Usage

To just start the app, use `make dev`.

To start the app in "development mode" (it gets restarted on code changes and main.css is being regenerated on detected TailwindCSS related rules), use:

1. `./run_app.sh` to run the app.<br>
   This requires having [entr](https://eradman.com/entrproject/) installed on your system.
2. `./run_css.sh` to run the TailwindCSS compiler.
